# Lushed, a projectional editor

As my lush experimentations progressed, I discovered that `lushed`, the
editor was a personal take on a (now) marginal academic field :
projectional editors.

With the help of gemini, I document what is an projectional editor and
in what way what I try to implement. This will serve as initial context
for AI agents.

## Gifs

As soon as I get something visible.
A moving image is worth thousand words.
Probably this will be yaml editing in the language studio.
First structural editing

## Random repos

They contain various experimentations destined to inform the current
project.

## An implementation

## Yaml

YAML is the first target because it is  simple as an [idempotent projection](/INTENDED-PATH.md#yaml-as-idempotent-projection)

## Doc files

* [Glossary](/GLOSSARY.md) is a glossary about projectional edition
without much details.
* [Posh Impact](/POSH-IMPACT.md) describes how my project is specific.
AST node must contain the text position.
* [Location Range](/LOC-RANGE.md)
document the conventions.

I want to design `leste` a posh for `svelte` and a playground similar to
[svelte.dev](https://svelte.dev/)
