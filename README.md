# projectional editor

As my lush experimentations progressed, I discovered that lushed the
editor was a personal take on a (now) marginal academic field :
projectional editors.

With the help of gemini, I document what is an projectional editor and
in what way what I try to implement. This will serve as initial context
for AI agents.
