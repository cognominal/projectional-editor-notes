# Glossary: Posh & Embedded Projectional Editing

## Model

The central, single source of truth representing the program's logic and data.
It is a structured collection of nodes (the AST) that exists independently of
how it is displayed. Changes to the model are immediately reflected in all its
projections.

## Structural token

Before a computer builds a tree, it needs to break a long string of text
into "meaningful chunks."
These are tokens. While most tokens represent values (like x or 10), structural
tokens are the characters that define the hierarchy and boundaries of the code.

## Embedding

The practice of nesting one language or model directly inside another. In
projectional editors, this is seamless because nodes from different languages
can coexist in the same AST without syntax confliscts.

## Posh, short for  Posh Projection

A projection style where font styling (bolding, italics, colors, sizes, and
weights) serves as the primary notation. Instead of using symbols like brackets
or keywords, "Posh" uses visual weight to define scope and hierarchy.

## Two-Level Embedding (Enhanced YAML)

A specific implementation where a data-centric model (like YAML) acts as a host
for a logic-level. This allows for interpolating variables directly into a
structured data tree, merging static config with dynamic execution.

## Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)

The underlying data structure. In an embedded context, the AST becomes a
heterogeneous tree where nodes may belong to different schemas (e.g., a YAML
node containing a Python expression node).

## Concrete Syntax Tree (CST)

A Concrete Syntax Tree, also known as a Parse Tree, is a high-fidelity
representation of the source code. It captures every single detail present
in the source, including those structural tokens mentioned above.

## Structural Editing

Manipulating the AST directly. In "Posh" mode, the user interacts with styled
text blocks; though it looks like "rich text" editing, every font change
corresponds to a structural change in the model.

## Persistence

The underlying storage (XML/JSON). For two-level embedding, persistence must
track which parts belong to the host (YAML) and which belong to the
interpolated logic for proper variable scoping. Projectional Editor

## Projectional Editor

An IDE or editor where users manipulate the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) directly
via a projected view. Unlike text editors, there is no parsing of raw text; the
UI renders the model based on defined rules.
